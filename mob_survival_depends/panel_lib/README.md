### Config
Have a read at the [DOCS](https://gitlab.com/zughy-friends-minetest/scoreboard_lib/-/blob/master/DOCS.md) to understand how to use it


### Collaborating
Something's wrong? Feel free to:
* open an [issue](https://gitlab.com/zughy-friends-minetest/panel_lib/-/issues)
* submit a merge request. In this case, PLEASE, do follow milestones and my [coding guidelines](https://cryptpad.fr/pad/#/2/pad/view/-l75iHl3x54py20u2Y5OSAX4iruQBdeQXcO7PGTtGew/embed/). I won't merge features for milestones that are different from the upcoming one (if it's declared), nor messy code
