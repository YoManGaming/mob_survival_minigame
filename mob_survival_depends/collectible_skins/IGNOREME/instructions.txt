This folder shall contain all the information regarding the skins linked to this world. DO NOT rename folders or the mod won't be able to read them.

skins are stored in .yml files. Every file represents a collection and it must contain the `_COLLECTION_INFO` field. This is how it looks like:

_COLLECTION_INFO:
    technical_name: my_coll
    name: My collection!
    image: foo_bar.png                                                      # optional image to display in the upper left corner of the built-in UI. Recommended size is 87x69
    background: foobar_bar.png                                              # optional background for the right part of the built-in UI. Recommended size is 206x138
    order: skin_name_1, skin_name_2, another_skin_name, and_another         # skins not specified in this field will be randomly put at the end of the list
    weight: 1                                                               # weights define the collections order. Collections with heavier weights are put further down in the built-in GUI. Not declaring the weight sets its value to 0

Every file can contain multiple skins, and skins must follow the template down below: 'skin_name' is the technical name without spaces of sort, `name` is the readable one.

skin_name:
    name:
    description:
    texture:
    hint: (optional, default "(locked)")
    model: (optional, default none)
    tier: (optional, default 1)

/locale is for translation files, in case you want to geolocalise your collections and your skins (name, description). It's highly recommended to rename the example files, so put whatever name you want, followed by the country code the file represents and .tr. For instance, a translation file for Spanish would be "mycoolgame.es.tr".

/menu is for customising the skin selection formspec. DO NOT rename files or they won't work, just override them with your custom image.

/textures is for images in general (skin, more things in the future).
