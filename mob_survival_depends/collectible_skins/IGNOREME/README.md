**EDITING THIS FOLDER IS USELESS, EDIT THE ONE WITH THE SAME NAME IN THE WORLD FOLDER INSTEAD**

The first time the world is launched with `collectible_skins` on, this folder is copy-pasted into the world folder (with this sole exception of this file). The purpose of this folder is to provide all the menu assets and a few skins by default. These skins help modders understand how to implement their ones more easily.
